The .exe file can be found in HighGroundWpf > bin > debug > HighGroundWpf.exe

The most important file is HighGroundWpf > MainWindow.xaml.cs This contains my
algorithm for simulated annealing and steepest ascent. The .xaml files just
contain code on the layout of the GUI.

I have included several excel files from real runs.

If you have visual studio, open HighGroundWpf.sln. This is the project file and will contain everything in one organized place.
